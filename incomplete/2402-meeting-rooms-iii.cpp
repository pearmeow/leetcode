 * 2402. Meeting Rooms III
 * You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.
 * You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during
 * the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique. Meetings are allocated to rooms in
 * the following manner: Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number. If there are no
 * available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same
 * duration as the original meeting. When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time
 * should be given the room. Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms,
 * return the room with the lowest number. A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and
 * not including b.
