 * 1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition
 * You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target.
 * Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is
 * less or equal to target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
