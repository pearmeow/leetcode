 * 3439. Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time I
 * You are given an integer eventTime denoting the duration of an event, where the event occurs from time t = 0 to time
 * t = eventTime. You are also given two integer arrays startTime and endTime, each of length n. These represent the
 * start and end time of n non-overlapping meetings, where the ith meeting occurs during the time [startTime[i],
 * endTime[i]]. You can reschedule at most k meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the same duration, to
 * maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event. The relative order of all the meetings should
 * stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping. Return the maximum amount of free time possible after
 * rearranging the meetings. Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event.
